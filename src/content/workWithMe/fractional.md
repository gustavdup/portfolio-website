I help product teams that need senior leadership at a critical point of growth or change. This work is typically short to mid-term—spanning a few weeks to a few months—and often grows out of consulting engagements.

### Where I add the most value:

- Fractional product leadership
- Product discovery & roadmapping
- Systems thinking and product architecture
- SaaS growth, retention, and delivery clarity
- Improving team alignment, delivery practices, and onboarding
- Process improvement & product insights
