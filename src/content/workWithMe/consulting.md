I work with teams who need an outside perspectiveâ€”whether you're scaling up, integrating systems, or navigating delivery hurdles.

These are typically short, focused engagements where I help define direction, unblock teams, or bring clarity to complex decisions. If I'm not the right person for the work, I'll connect you with trusted partners or vendors who are.

### Where I can help:

- Product strategy and prioritisation workshops
- Discovery, GTM and roadmap planning
- Systems thinking and product architecture
- Team and business process audits
- Vendor referrals when needed
