I typically maintain one long-term engagement at a time—partnering deeply with a single company on strategic direction and sustained delivery. Alongside this, I take on short-term or consulting work when capacity allows.

My availability depends on my current long-term engagement, but when the time is right, I’m most energised by long-term opportunities that align with strong product ambition and team culture.

### I'm especially drawn to environments where I can:

- Shape product direction from discovery through delivery
- Lead or support high-performing, remote-first teams
- Align user needs with business goals and technical context
- Simplify complexity across systems and stakeholders
- Contribute to cultures built on autonomy, trust, and purpose
