I’m a product and technology leader with over a decade of experience delivering user-centered, scalable SaaS platforms across EdTech, visual collaboration, healthcare, and field services. My work spans product strategy, system design, integrations, and data-informed UX—across B2C, B2B, and B2B2C contexts.

I’ve led global teams in startups, scale-ups, and enterprise environments, guiding products from concept through launch and continuous improvement. I hold a Master’s in ICT Management and am completing a doctorate focused on improving user adoption and change readiness in enterprise software transitions.

Alongside long-term roles, I take on select freelance and consulting engagements when capacity allows—helping teams shape product direction, align strategy with execution, and move critical work forward.
